factorial.py

Test
$ ./factorial.py 2
2
$ ./factorial.py 5
120

Explanation of the Fix:
Decrement n: n -= 1 is added inside the while loop to reduce the value of n on each iteration. This allows the loop to eventually terminate when n is no longer greater than 1.

print_arguments.py

Test
./print_arguments.py 1 2 3

Explanation of the Fix:
Starting the loop from 1: By starting the loop with range(1, len(sys.argv)), we skip the first element (sys.argv[0]), which is the script name, and only print the actual arguments passed to the script.

2-
change_background.html

Test

Explanation of the Fix:
Corrected the id of the button: Changed id="colorButon" to id="colorButton" in the HTML to match what the JavaScript is referencing.

3-
mines.py

Test
Run the script and reveal cells. If all non-mine cells are revealed without hitting a mine, the game should print "Congratulations! You've won the game."

Explanation of the Fix:
self.revealed_count: Added to keep track of how many cells have been revealed.
self.non_mine_cells: Stores the number of cells that are not mines (total_cells - mines).
Win Condition Check: After revealing a cell, the game checks if self.revealed_count equals self.non_mine_cells. If true, the player wins the game, and a congratulatory message is displayed.

factorial_recursive.py

Test
$ ./factorial_recursive.py 4

Breakdown of the Documentation:
Function Description:

Provides a brief overview of what the function does, including the recursive nature of the computation.
Explains the concept of factorial and provides an example.
Parameters:

Describes the parameter n, specifying that it should be a non-negative integer.
Returns:

Explains what the function returns. It states that the result is the factorial of the given integer and notes the special case when n is 0.
Additional Notes:
Make sure to maintain proper indentation in your code for readability and correctness. In the provided code, the indentation of the return statement inside the factorial function was corrected.
This documentation style, which follows the convention of using triple quotes for docstrings, is helpful for generating documentation and understanding the code better.

checkbook.py

Test

Explanation of the Fix:
Explanation of the Fixes:
Error Handling in Input Conversion:

try and except blocks: Added around float(input(...)) to catch ValueError exceptions that occur if the input cannot be converted to a float. This prevents the program from crashing and provides a user-friendly error message.
Documentation for Methods:

Added docstrings to the Checkbook methods to describe their purpose and parameters. This improves code readability and helps understand the functionality of each method.
How to Test:
Run the script.
Test valid inputs by entering numeric values for deposit and withdrawal.
Test invalid inputs (e.g., entering text instead of a number) to ensure the error handling works as expected.
Verify that commands like balance and exit work correctly.
With these modifications, the program should be more robust and user-friendly, handling invalid inputs gracefully without crashing.

Changes Made:
Added Docstrings:

__init__: Describes the initialization of the Checkbook class.
deposit: Explains the parameters and what the method does.
withdraw: Explains the parameters and what the method does.
get_balance: Describes the method and its purpose.
main: Provides a description of the main function's purpose.
Error Handling:

Wrapped the float conversion in try blocks to catch ValueError exceptions for invalid numeric inputs. This prevents the program from crashing and prompts the user with a relevant error message if they enter non-numeric values.
Input Sanitization:

Used .strip() to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from user input before processing.
These changes improve the robustness of the code, making it more user-friendly and resistant to invalid input.

6-
tic.py

Test

Explanation of the Fix:
Explanation of the Fixes:
Player Win Announcement:

The player variable is checked for winning and is only switched if no one has won yet.
Out-of-Bounds Input Handling:

Added a check to ensure the input values for row and column are within the range [0, 1, 2].
Check for Draw Condition:

Added the is_draw() function to check if the board is full and thereâ€™s no winner, indicating a draw.
Exception Handling:

Added a try-except block to handle non-numeric inputs, preventing the program from crashing.
How to Test:
Valid Inputs:

Test by entering valid row and column values and make sure the game progresses correctly and announces winners or draws accurately.
Invalid Inputs:

Test by entering values outside the range (e.g., -1, 3) and non-numeric values to ensure the error handling works.
Draw Condition:

Test scenarios where all cells are filled without any player winning to ensure the draw condition is handled properly.

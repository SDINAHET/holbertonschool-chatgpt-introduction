factorial.py

Test
$ ./factorial.py 2
2
$ ./factorial.py 5
120

Explanation of the Fix:
Decrement n: n -= 1 is added inside the while loop to reduce the value of n on each iteration. This allows the loop to eventually terminate when n is no longer greater than 1.

print_arguments.py

Test
./print_arguments.py 1 2 3

Explanation of the Fix:
Starting the loop from 1: By starting the loop with range(1, len(sys.argv)), we skip the first element (sys.argv[0]), which is the script name, and only print the actual arguments passed to the script.

change_background.html

Test

Explanation of the Fix:
Corrected the id of the button: Changed id="colorButon" to id="colorButton" in the HTML to match what the JavaScript is referencing.

3-
mines.py

Test
Run the script and reveal cells. If all non-mine cells are revealed without hitting a mine, the game should print "Congratulations! You've won the game."

Explanation of the Fix:
self.revealed_count: Added to keep track of how many cells have been revealed.
self.non_mine_cells: Stores the number of cells that are not mines (total_cells - mines).
Win Condition Check: After revealing a cell, the game checks if self.revealed_count equals self.non_mine_cells. If true, the player wins the game, and a congratulatory message is displayed.

factorial_recursive.py

Test

Breakdown of the Documentation:
Function Description:

Provides a brief overview of what the function does, including the recursive nature of the computation.
Explains the concept of factorial and provides an example.
Parameters:

Describes the parameter n, specifying that it should be a non-negative integer.
Returns:

Explains what the function returns. It states that the result is the factorial of the given integer and notes the special case when n is 0.
Additional Notes:
Make sure to maintain proper indentation in your code for readability and correctness. In the provided code, the indentation of the return statement inside the factorial function was corrected.
This documentation style, which follows the convention of using triple quotes for docstrings, is helpful for generating documentation and understanding the code better.
